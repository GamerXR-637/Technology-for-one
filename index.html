    Technology for One is an organization dedicated to minimizing e-waste and promoting environmental sustainability. We encourage individuals to donate their old electronic devices, which we refurbish and distribute to those in need or to individuals who may not have the means to afford them. We also host events where donors can enter a raffle for a chance to win various prizes from our selection. Additionally, we collaborate with partners such as Microsoft and World Computer Exchange, contributing refurbished systems to support their initiatives. Through our subdivision, Chess for Cancer, we provide laptops to individuals who have triumphed over cancer, enabling them to utilize these devices for their personal needs.

    As we continue to grow, we are excited to announce that we will be partnering with the World Computer Exchange to expand our impact and service!
    The following directions are partners of us:
